# Bio-Informatic-Neural-Network
Artificial Neural Network to perform DNA Sequencing by grouping DNA samples with similar base sequences.

## Features
- 64 input nodes
- Hidden layer with 44 nodes
- an output layer with 1 node
- FeedForward Algorithm

## Installation

Use the follwing command on the terminal to run. 

```bash
python3 neuralNet.py
```

This generates a file[prediction.csv] file that contains the grouped DNA Sequences.

## Libraries used

You need the following Libraries installed to tun the app. Alternatively you can install [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) which has all the required libraries preinstalled

```python
pandas
numpy
sciPy
